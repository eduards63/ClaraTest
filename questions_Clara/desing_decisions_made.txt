Explanation of design decisions made:

The framework was designed with maintainability and scalability as core principles, adopting the Page Object Model (POM) to separate test logic from UI selectors,
making tests more resilient to changes. Cypress was chosen over Selenium for its built-in features like automatic waiting and real-time reloads, significantly reducing flakiness.
Multi-environment support was implemented through config files to enable testing across different stages without code changes. API testing was integrated alongside UI tests for comprehensive validation,
while data-driven testing via JSON fixtures allows for easy test case expansion. The inclusion of parallel execution and CI/CD integration optimizes feedback speed, and code coverage ensures test effectiveness.
Multi-language support and automated reporting make the framework adaptable for global teams and stakeholders.
