Your company is growing rapidly, and the number of product features increases every sprint. The execution time of automated tests has doubled in the last 3 months.

Propose a strategy to reduce execution time without compromising coverage:
    Response:
    To improve efficiency, tests should be categorized based on execution time and purpose, for example:
    .- Smoke Tests (5-10 min): Run on every commit to validate core functionalities.
    .- Regression Tests (30-40 min): Executed nightly or triggered by specific tags.
    .- Critical E2E Tests (10 min): Focus on essential workflows like checkout and login.
    Additionally, redundant tests should be eliminated—for example, removing multiple tests that check the same endpoint with different data variations.
    This streamlines execution while maintaining robust coverage.

Explain how you would reorganize the automation framework structure to make it more scalable:
    Response:
    .-Create or update a modular structure; a well-organized framework improves maintenance and scalability.
    This modular setup make it easier to maintain and onboard new teams efficiently.
    .-Desing Patterns like a Page Object where we standarize commo interactions, such as logi()  for the UI automation, also service classes for centralize API calls
    with structured functions, like user.create().
    .-Create a environment configuration using files like config files to handle environment-specific variables like URLs or credentials without hardcoding them.

Describe how you would implement parallel testing and what challenges you would anticipate:
    Response:
    To optimize parallel testing, I would start by configuring distributed test execution using native tools like Cypress, which allow splitting the test suite into independent
    workers
    In CI/CD, I’d leverage job matrices (such as in GitHub Actions) to parallelize tests by modules (e.g., smoke, regression) or by test files, ensuring each worker processes 
    a balanced subset.
    The biggest challenges would be report consolidation and managing infrastructure costs, requiring efficient log aggregation and resource optimization to maintain 
    scalability without unnecessary overhead.
