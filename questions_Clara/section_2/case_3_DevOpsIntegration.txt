Your organization is adopting more advanced DevOps and CI/CD practices.

Explain how you would integrate automated tests into a CI/CD pipeline
    Response:
    I believe that for a successful integration of automated test cases into the CI/CD pipeline, tests should be included at every 
    stage of the process. In the CI phase, unit tests and integration tests should be executed with every commit to help detect errors early.
    In the CD phase, end-to-end tests, performance tests, and security tests (if there is a QA specialist for these) should be run to ensure
    quality without compromising security or performance when deploying to staging or production.

Describe what metrics you would establish to evaluate the quality and performance of tests
    Response:
    For me, the key metrics to monitor in order to ensure quality and performance are code coverage, pass/fail rate, execution time, and early 
    bug detection. Other metrics may vary depending on the project and whether they should be implemented.
    There are also tools like SonarQube (which I have worked with) that help streamline code tracking and make it easier to generate these 
    types of reports.


Detail how you would handle quick feedback on code quality
    Response:
    I believe that integrating applications like SonarQube, which run directly within the CI pipeline, helps reduce the time required to complete
     a pull request (PR) and provides fast feedback on code quality.
    I would also integrate this with a team communication channel or via email to send reports and alerts, ensuring higher code quality.
