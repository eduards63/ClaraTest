You have noticed that 15% of automated tests intermittently fail in the CI/CD environment without a clear pattern. Describe:

Methodology you would use to analyze and classify these failures:
    Response:
    First, I would gather data on CI/CD failures, including logs, screenshots, and Cypress videos, then classify them into categories like:
    .-Timing Issues: Failures due to improper handling of dynamic elements, such as slow APIs or animations.  
    .-External Dependencies: Unstable third-party APIs or shared data between tests.  
    .-Fragile Selectors: XPaths or CSS selectors that vary between executions.  
    .-Inconsistent Environment: Differences between local and CI setups, such as timeouts or configuration mismatches.  
    
    This structured approach helps pinpoint recurring issues and refine automation strategies for more reliable tests.

Strategies to solve each type of identified problem:
    Response:
    For each category, I would apply the following strategies:

    .-Timing Issues: Replace sleep() with smarter waits, such as cy.intercept() in Cypress. Implement conditional retries, but only for known errors like ElementNotVisibleException.
    .-External Dependencies: Mock APIs using WireMock in test environments to reduce reliance on unstable third-party services. Ensure data isolation by generating unique IDs with UUID.
    .-Fragile Selectors: Prioritize static attributes like data-testid instead of unreliable XPaths. Use Page Objects to centralize selectors, making maintenance easier and improving
    test stability.
    .-Inconsistent Environments: Containerize the CI setup with Docker to maintain consistency across executions. Adjust timeouts based on the environment, allowing for longer waits 
    in CI compared to local runs.

How you would evaluate the effectiveness of your solutions:
    Response:
    One of the ways would be:
    Key Metrics:
    .- Reduce flakiness to <2% within 2-3 sprints.
    .- Average failure diagnosis time of less than 15 minutes per case.
    Continuous Monitoring:
    .-Creating dashboard displaying weekly flaky test trends, stable exectuion times and team retrospective to refine stratagies.
    Regression Testing:
    .-Create and run dedicate pipeline where run flaky test separately with increases retries.
